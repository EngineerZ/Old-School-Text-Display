 
The files in this repository are for an Open Source Hardware PCB to support 
four DL1414 alphanumeric LED display modeules, yielding a 16-character 
display.  The four modules are controlled by an I2C expander module making 
it compatiple with many popular microcontroller platforms.

This repository contains the following files:
